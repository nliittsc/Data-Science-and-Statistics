This folder just contains the various data files I have extracted or otherwise created throughout my analysis. 

Unfortunately, the actual california traffic stop data is too large to upload here, but may be found at https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/data/ and if you want to obtain my subsample, you can run `stratifiedSubsample.R` over in the `Data Processing and Sampling` folder. 

Otherwise, I will upload what I can here.
