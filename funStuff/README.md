This folder is just a collection of funnote books that I have decided to make. Below are some descriptions.

`probabilityFailClass.ipynb` is a notebook that tries to give a probabilistic answer to "How much can you slack off in a class and still pass?"
The idea was to create a hypothetical class room and grading scheme, and then, under different conditions, calculate the probability you fail
the class with just random guessing. Essentially I developed a probability model and simulator for estimating your chances of passing a class
given the probability you get any one question right. So is the probability of failing 100% if you flip a coin on each answer? Somehow, no!
